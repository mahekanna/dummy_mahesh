This folder contains scripts that were created during the development phase to fix specific issues but are no longer needed as their functionality has been integrated into the main project.

## Scripts Moved (July 8, 2025)

## Why These Were Moved

All these scripts addressed temporary issues during development:

1. **Configuration issues** - Now handled by `deploy_complete.sh`
2. **Database setup problems** - Integrated into main deployment
3. **Authentication bugs** - Fixed in core `config/users.py` and authentication modules
4. **Template errors** - Corrected in `web_portal/templates/`
5. **Code bugs** - Fixed in respective source files

## Remaining Active Scripts

The following scripts remain in the main directory as they provide ongoing utility:

- `deploy_complete.sh` - Primary production deployment
- `deploy_interactive.sh` - Interactive deployment option
- `setup_master_csv_sync.sh` - CSV synchronization utility
- `diagnose_issues.sh` - Troubleshooting tool
- `foolproof_setup.sh` - Development environment setup
- `demo_setup.sh` - Demo environment configuration

## Recovery

If any of these scripts are needed for reference, they can be found here. However, their functionality should already be available in the main project files.
